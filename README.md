# OPA (Open Policy Agent)
OPA Policy Showcase Repository. This repository is designed as a comprehensive guide to creating and managing policies with Open Policy Agent (OPA). It includes a Dockerfile for easy setup and deployment of an OPA environment, along with several example policies to get you started.
## Features
Docker Support: A Dockerfile is provided to build a Docker image that encapsulates OPA, making it simple to deploy OPA in any environment that supports Docker.
Sample Policies: Jumpstart your policy creation with our included sample policies. These examples cover common use cases and provide a solid foundation for developing your own custom policies.
Curl Commands: Test and interact with your OPA deployment directly from the command line. We provide sample curl commands to demonstrate how to query OPA policies effectively.
OPA CLI Tools: Explore the full capabilities of OPA with included CLI commands. These commands help you manage your policies, perform tests, and integrate OPA into your CI/CD pipeline.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine and follow the instructions in the README to build your Docker image and run OPA. The README also includes detailed explanations of each component and step-by-step guides on how to use the curl commands and CLI tools to interact with your OPA deployment.
